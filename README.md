# Credit Score Prediction Using Data Science

**Course:** Principle of Data Science (CSE 4357)  
**University:** IUBAT – International University of Business Agriculture and Technology  
**Section:** N  

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how data science techniques can be applied to predict credit scores based on financial and demographic attributes. The system analyzes customer financial behavior and builds predictive models using machine learning and deep learning.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains 1000 synthetic but realistic records with the following attributes:
- Age  
- Annual Income  
- Financial Responsibility (1–10 scale)  
- On-Time Payment (%)  
- Credit Utilization (%)  
- Credit Score  

The dataset includes missing values and realistic variations to simulate real-world financial data.

## ⚙️ Methods Used
- Data Cleaning and Median Imputation
- Missing Value Indicators
- Feature Scaling (Standardization)
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Correlation Analysis
- Machine Learning (Random Forest Regression)
- Deep Learning (Neural Network)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
Since this is a regression problem, the following metrics were used:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

## 🧠 Key Findings
- Annual income has a strong positive correlation with credit score.
- Credit utilization shows a negative relationship with credit score.
- Random Forest outperforms the neural network for this dataset.
